Early life
Robert John Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965,[2] in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of the two children.[3] His father, Robert Downey Sr. (né Elias), was a filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (née Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films.[4] Downey's father was of one half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one quarter Irish, ancestry, and Downey's mother had Scottish, German, and Swiss roots.[5][6][7][8]

Downey moved often, mainly due to his father's film projects, living in places such as Woodstock, New York, London, New Mexico, California, Connecticut, and Greenwich Village.[9] The family experienced both periods of near-poverty and wealth, depending on the success of the films.[10] As a child, Downey was "surrounded by drugs."[11] His father was a drug addict, and his mother was an alcoholic.[12] His father allowed him to use drugs at a young age; he said that he gave Downey marijuana for the first time at age six and also gave Downey cocaine as a child.[13] His father later said that he regretted it.[3] Downey stated that he and his father did drugs together for the first time when he was eight, and that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: "When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how."[14][15][16]

During his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy film Pound (1970), and then, at seven, appeared in the surrealist Western film Greaser's Palace (1972).[6] He went to Stagedoor Manor, a summer acting camp in upstate New York, when he was eleven and twelve.[10] Downey's parents divorced in 1977, when he was twelve. He went and lived with his mother in a fifth-floor apartment in New York, as she "needed" him after the divorce, while his sister went to live with their father in California.[14] After a few years, Downey went to live with his father and began attending Santa Monica High School, but dropped out in 1982.[17] At the age of 17, he moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time.[18] Downey worked a number of different jobs to support himself while going to auditions, including clearing tables at Central Falls restaurant, working in a shoe store, and performing as "living art" at the nightclub Area.[19][20][21] Meanwhile, Downey got a few parts in local theater and off-Broadway productions. He got his first credited film role in the 1983 film Baby It's You; however, his scenes ended up being cut.</p>
